A lightweight Windows utility that instantly places a very dark, transparent overlay over your screen to reduce eye strain and protect against sudden white flashes.

Designed for users who are sensitive to brightness spikes (web browsing, dark mode switching, IDE flashes, loading screens, etc.), this tool creates a fullscreen dimming layer that is completely click-through — meaning you can continue using your computer normally while it is active.

Toggle the overlay on or off at any time using a simple global keyboard shortcut.
